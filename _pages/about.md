Hi! I am Sambad, a PhD Candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mae.mst.edu/) at the [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla](https://www.mst.edu/). I expect to graduate in July, 2021. Currently, I am working on setting up the experiment for overground physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The work includes developing an appropriate control algorithm that is best suited for our experiment, designing the data acquisition techniques, and exploring data analysis techniques that can be used for analyzing future human movement data.

Work and Research
======
As a research assistant, I am working in the Physical Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory (pHRI Lab) under the supervision of [Dr. Yun Seong Song](https://mae.mst.edu/facultyandstaff/facultysong/) in the NSF funded project "Human Arm Impedance Modulation during Overground Physical Interactions". In the lab, we have designed and developed, as a part of my PhD project, a robotic arm that is capable of applying precise force perturbation during human interaction experiments. The robotic arm is lodged on top of the autonomous mobile body, which was outsourced from [SuperDroid Robots](https://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/ig52-db4-4wd-all-terrain-heavy-duty-robot-platform/1648/). The integrated robot can be used as a speed controlled trajectory tracker, as a leader of overground pHRI experiments, and is also capable of providing occasional force perturbations through the endpoint of the arm, which is the only point of communication with the human follower during the experiment. Movement data at various location/parts will be collected during the experiment; robot motion data can be collected using wheel encoders and arm motor encoders whereas movement of human body parts can be recorded using vicon motion capture systems. The captured data, after required preprocessing, will be analyzed to extract meaningful information on how the human arm impedance is modulated during overground human-robot interaction. 

In course of robot development, we also developed a simulator model of the robotic arm based on its dynamics. This simulator not only helped us weighing up the effectiveness of the robotic arm based on its endpoint impedance but also will helps us in designing the effective control algorithms, which is the work in progress.

My research interests mainly lie within the field of **human neuromechanics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Human-human and human-robot interaction
1. Data acquisition
1. Data analysis
1. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
1. Robotics and controls

In addition, I also work as a graduate teaching assistant for [Control System Laboratory](https://mae.mst.edu/facilities/learninglabcontrolsys/) in which I assist students in hardware implementaion of control techniques with the help of PLC and LabVIEW software.
