Hi! I am Sambad, a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla. I will graduate in May, 2021. Currently I am working on setting up the experiment for overground physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The work includes developing an appropriate control algorithm that is best suited for the experiment, designing the data acquisition technique, and exploring data analysis techniques for future human data.

Work and Research
======
The experiment will make use of the robotic arm, which was designed and developed in our Lab as my PhD project to apply precise force perturbation while the robot (developed robotic arm + outsourced lower body) leads along the specified trajectory. The movement data collected will be utilized to extract meaningful information on human arm impedance during overground human-robot interaction.

My research interests mainly lie within the field of **human neuromechanics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Human-human and human-robot interaction
1. Data acquisition
1. Data analysis
1. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
1. Robotics and controls.

Background
======
I received my Bachelor in Engineering (BE) from Visvesvarya Technological University, Bengalure through Nepal Aid Fund Scholarship Scheme 2012-2013, Minisitry of Education, India.
