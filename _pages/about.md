Hi! I am Sambad, a PhD Candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mae.mst.edu/) at the [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla](https://www.mst.edu/). I expect to graduate in July, 2021. Currently, I am working on setting up the experiment for overground physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The work includes developing an appropriate control algorithm that is best suited for our experiment, designing the data acquisition techniques, and exploring data analysis techniques that can be used for analyzing future human movement data.

Research Interests
======
My research interests mainly lie within the field of **mechatronics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Robotics and controls
1. Data acquisition and analysis of human experiments
1. Rehabilitation robotics
1. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
1. Human-human and human-robot interaction
1. Human neuromechancis

Background
======
I received my Bachelor in Engineering (BE) from [Visvesvarya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in/en/), Bengaluru with the scholarship from [COMPEX 2012 Scholarship Scheme](https://www.indembkathmandu.gov.in/page/about-education-and-scholarship/), Embassy of India in Kathmandu, Nepal.
