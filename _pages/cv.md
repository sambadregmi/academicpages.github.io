Work experience
======
* August 2017 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant, <i> Missouri University of Science and Technology </i>
  * Designed and developed robotic manipulator for physical human robot interaction experiments; Selected required hardware and software for the robot; and, currently trying to implement various force, position, and velocity control strategies on the robot
  * Developed a "dynamics" simulator of a robotic manipulator using Lagrangian method; estimated the friction/damping of rotational joints, and verified its accuracy using the effective inertia estimate; developed a method to estimate the output impedance of a manipulator using the robotic simulator
  * Currently selecting a data acquisition and analysis technique for experiments involving our robot
  * Currently, designing and conducting a human-robot interaction experiment, including acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, collecting and analyzing the data, and reporting results
* June 2016 - June 2017: Quality Assurance and Maintenance Engineer, <i>Nepal Health Research Council </i>
  * Involved in solving various issues related to the equipment for ECG and Sprirometry tests that were used in project "Prevalence of Chronic Diseases in Nepal"}
  * Coordinated with health workers and patients for smooth and effortless use of the devices}
  

Teaching and Mentoring Experience
