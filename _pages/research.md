Ph.D Research
=========
### Development of an Interactive Robot for Overground Physical Human-Robot Interaction** (August 2017 - Present) 
As a research assistant, I have been working in the Physical Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory (pHRI Lab) under the supervision of Dr. Yun Seong Song in the NSF funded project "Human Arm Impedance Modulation during Overground Physical Interactions". I can divide my Ph.D research into following
#### Development of overground robot that is capable of doing simple physical human-robot interection experiment.
  ##### Developement of robotic arm (manipulator) 
The robotic arm is lodged on top of the autonomous mobile body, which was outsourced from [SuperDroid Robots](https://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/ig52-db4-4wd-all-terrain-heavy-duty-robot-platform/1648/). The integrated robot can be used as a speed controlled trajectory tracker, as a leader of overground pHRI experiments, and is also capable of providing occasional force perturbations through the endpoint of the arm, which is the only point of communication with the human follower during the experiment. Movement data at various location/parts will be collected during the experiment; robot motion data can be collected using wheel encoders and arm motor encoders whereas movement of human body parts can be recorded using vicon motion capture systems. The captured data, after required preprocessing, will be analyzed to extract meaningful information on how the human arm impedance is modulated during overground human-robot interaction. 

In course of robot development, we also developed a simulator model of the robotic arm based on its dynamics. This simulator not only helped us weighing up the effectiveness of the robotic arm based on its endpoint impedance but also will helps us in designing the effective control algorithms, which is the work in progress.

Undergraduate Project
=========
**Conceptualization and Fabrication of Mini-Tunnel Boring Machine** (Jan 2016 - May 2016)\
Worked together and coordinated with three other group members to come up to a concept of a portable and affordable boring machine for smaller boring projects. The concept latter was implemented as a fabricated demo model.
