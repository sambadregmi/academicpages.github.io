# Ph.D Research
## Development of an Interactive Robot for Overground Physical Human-Robot Interaction ### 
As a research assistant, I have been working in the Physical Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory (pHRI Lab) under the supervision of Dr. Yun Seong Song in the NSF funded project "Human Arm Impedance Modulation during Overground Physical Interactions". Following shows the outline my Ph.D research;
### Phase I: Development of overground robot 
  * Developement of robotic arm\
  Due to the uniqueness of robot (i.e. capable of doing overground physical human-robot interection tasks), the robotic arm (manipulator) had to be designed and then built in our lab. The unique kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the robotic arm were identified and calculated. The second order non-linear dynamics of the arm was derived and hence was coded into the a simulator model of the robotic arm. This simulator not only helped us weighing up the effectiveness of the robotic arm based on its endpoint impedance but also will helped us in designing the effective control algorithms.

  * Identifying appropriate hardware and controller unit\
  Depending on the requirement of the robotic amr, and also in order to control the robot, it was crucial to get the appropriate actuators, sensor and controller. Anehiem Automation Inc.'s actuators (BLDC motors - to reduce friction), ATI force/torque sensors, and National Instrument's cRIO real time controller were choosen.
  
### Phase II: Assembly
### Phase III: Implementing control and Validation
  The robotic arm is lodged on top of the autonomous mobile body, which was outsourced from [SuperDroid Robots](https://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/ig52-db4-4wd-all-terrain-heavy-duty-robot-platform/1648/). The integrated robot can be used as a speed controlled trajectory tracker, as a leader of overground pHRI experiments, and is also capable of providing occasional force perturbations through the endpoint of the arm, which is the only point of communication with the human follower during the experiment. Movement data at various location/parts will be collected during the experiment; robot motion data can be collected using wheel encoders and arm motor encoders whereas movement of human body parts can be recorded using vicon motion capture systems. The captured data, after required preprocessing, will be analyzed to extract meaningful information on how the human arm impedance is modulated during overground human-robot interaction. 

# Undergraduate Project
## Conceptualization and Fabrication of Mini-Tunnel Boring Machine
Worked together and coordinated with three other group members to come up to a concept of a portable and affordable boring machine for smaller boring projects. The concept latter was implemented as a fabricated demo model.
